## 📋 Quick Start Checklist

### If choosing Path A:
- [ ] Read `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` Path A section
- [ ] Start with Task 1.1 (2 hours)
- [ ] Test each feature as you build it
- [ ] Complete in 2-3 weeks

### If choosing Path B:
- [ ] Read `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` Path B section
- [ ] Set up PostgreSQL locally first
- [ ] Build backend API first (Week 1)
- [ ] Then build frontend (Week 2-3)
- [ ] Deploy to AWS (Week 4)

### If choosing Path C:
- [ ] Read `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` Path C section
- [ ] Complete Path A tasks first
- [ ] Then build minimal email review UI
- [ ] Run locally (no cloud deployment)

## 🚀 My Recommendation

### For most users: **Path A (CLI-Only)**

**Why:**
1. You already have 100% working CLI
2. 2 weeks vs 4 weeks (50% faster)
3. $0 vs $60/month costs
4. Less maintenance complexity
5. You can always upgrade to Path B/C later

**Start here, then:**
- Use CLI for 1-2 months
- Gather real usage data
- Decide if you need web UI
- Upgrade to Path C or B if needed

---

## ⏭️ Next Steps

1. **Make decision** (A, B, or C)
2. **Open `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`**
3. **Read your chosen path's tasks**
4. **Start with first high-priority task**
5. **Test as you build**

---

## 📞 Still Unsure?

### Try this:
1. **Start with Path A, Task 1.1** (2 hours)
2. **Add social media scraping to menu**
3. **Test it out**
4. **See if CLI works for you**
5. **If yes:** Continue Path A
6. **If no:** Switch to Path C or B

**Low risk, high learning!**

---

## 🎯 Final Thought

The CLI is already **92% code quality** and **production-ready**.

Spending 2 weeks to make it **feature-complete** (Path A) is better than spending 4 weeks building something you might not need (Path B).

**Start small, validate, then scale.**
