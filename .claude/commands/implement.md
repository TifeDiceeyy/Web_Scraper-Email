# Feature Implementation Workflow

Orchestrates the 3-phase feature development process.

## Phases

```
Phase 1+2: /discovery           → Requirements + Architecture
Phase 3+3.5: /plan-and-validate → Plan + Validation
Phase 4: /start-implementation  → Build + Test + Commit
```

## Rules

- Complete each phase before moving to next
- Get user approval before implementation
- Follow existing patterns from codebase

## Skills Used

The workflow uses these skills for deep dives:

- `development-workflow` - Standards and git workflow
- `exploration-helpers` - Database/codebase exploration
- `project-standards` - User story format

## Starting

**I'm now triggering Discovery (Phase 1+2).**

This will:

1. Explore current app state
2. Read user story (if provided)
3. Ask clarifying questions
4. Review architecture and standards

After Discovery, I'll ask to proceed to Planning.
